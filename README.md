**Advanced 911 - By FAXES**

**About**
Tonight I release a (YES I :roll_eyes:) 911 script. But this is not the average 911 call script. In this you can define ped's that will receive the calls (Eg; If you do `/911 pd help me` the message will only be seen by people within the LEO group (defined in the files)). The same thing goes for the fire / ems groups -- These groups are mixed into 1 for you. **I plan to make a responding cmd that sets the location the the call.** I have had this ready to release for a while now, just did not get around to actually releasing it...
